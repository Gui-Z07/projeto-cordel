            I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen <br>
            So dig two graves, 'cause when you die <br>
            I swear I'll be leaving by your side <br>
            So, you can drag me through hell <br>
            If it meant I could hold your hand <br>

            And it's not worth saving <br>

            Now, I'm walking around in a haze <br>
            There's no color only <br>
            Darker shades of gray <br>
            You showed me the way when <br>
            I was lost and alone <br>
            But you never really showed me how  <br>
            To let you go" <br>

            "I close my eyes <br>
            Only for a moment <br> 
            And the moment's gone <br>
            All my dreams <br>
            Pass before my eyes, a curiosity <br>
            
            Dust in the wind <br>
            All they are is <br>
            Dust in the wind <br>
            All they are is dust in the wind <br>
            Same old song <br>
            Just a drop of water in an endless sea <br>
            All we do <br>
            Crumbles to the ground <br>            
            Though we refuse to see <br>

            Dust in the wind (oh) <br>
            All we are is dust in the wind" <br>

            I set a course for winds of fortune <br>
